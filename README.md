What Is reCAPTCHA?
reCAPTCHA is a human verification system developed in 2007 and purchased by Google in 2009. Initially, the tool was developed to help digitize books that couldn’t be scanned by computers. Once enacted to verify users, reCAPTCHA displayed two different distorted words with lines running through them (compared to CAPTCHA’s random sequences of letters and numbers).

By 2012, the project began incorporating images from Google Street View. By now, you’ve almost certainly spent a decent chunk of time clicking all of the images that contain a stoplight just to prove you’re not a bot. And you’ve probably failed some of these tests, too! As noted by Baymard Institute, “Only 66% of users during our qualitative usability testing successfully entered the CAPTCHA on the first attempt.”

There were a few more iterations of reCAPTCHA, including the noCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA (where low-risk users only had to click a checkbox that stated “I’m not a robot”) and reCAPTCHA v3.

About reCAPTCHA v3
In 2018, Google unveiled reCAPTCHA v3, the latest iteration of the tool. Even if you’re an incredibly proficient internet user, there’s a good chance you’re scratching your chin and wondering whether you’ve come across reCAPTCHA v3 before.

With reCAPTCHA v3, you don’t have to decipher distorted words, you don’t have to click boxes to indicate you know what a car looks like, and you don’t even have to click the “I’m not a robot” checkbox, either. That’s because reCAPTCHA v3 exists largely in the background—completely invisible to the average user.

As such, reCAPTCHA v3 helps companies detect bots while ostensibly delivering a better user experience—but it hurts user privacy in exchange.
